# Bill Tracker (name pending)
## CM20257 Coursework

We propose a system to allow users to both learn about and react to bills passing through Parliament, ultimately encouraging users of the system to engage in the political process. We plan on using a social media style interface to present the bills and allow users to react, to provide young people with a familiar and modern interface to the political process. However, we simultaneously aim to make the interface formal enough that the content is engaged with in a meaningful way.

Our system aims to tackle the growing trend of political disengagement in the UK [1], particularly among younger people. Our system exposes the user to the movement of bills through the Houses of Parliament, including the decisions of MP’s and Lords at readings. The system will highlight the real political decisions of the user’s local MP in particular, drawing from the primary source of the Parliamentary websites - important when trust in the credibility of politicians fluctuates around 9% [2]. 

Our system is focussed on users within the UK, as the political process varies widely around the world, so other countries would require their own interactive systems. We have read further into the UK’s political process and engaged with representative potential users to gain insight into their goals and design opinions when designing our interface.
